# doubly-linked-list
Implement a doubly linked list data structure using C programming constructs


/* Description of function used in all files */

In the first file we have used typedef function to defne a structural node for the 
doubly linked list and named as dBll.

/* In the second file we need to insert an element and sort it in the sorted list */

To insert a new element we create memeory for the structural node using malloc and then we insert into the linked list.

The given list so we insert the element at the position and the sort it so we check 
by the bubble sort algorithm so we have 3 cases:

At first position
At any middle position 
At the last position
so we checked all of them by a set of decision making statements and then sort it
and terminate by printing it.

/* In the Third file we need to replace the element and then update the list */

First we find the element in the linked list by traversing and then on finding element we replace it.

Then keeping the replaced node we apply the same bubble sort algorithm ad obtain the sorted list in that time 

We have used int type specifiation but while using typedef we can use any data type as specification so our input specification 
will matter on that.
